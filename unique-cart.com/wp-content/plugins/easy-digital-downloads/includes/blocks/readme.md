# EDD Blocks

The EDD Blocks plugin can be installed and activated separately from EDD, but to use it, you will need to run the following command to install the build scripts (this command just needs to be run once):

```
npm install
```

To test a branch, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will make sure that your build directory is created and has the correct JavaScript and CSS files.
